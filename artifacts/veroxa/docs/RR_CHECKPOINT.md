# RR Release Checkpoint

Status: active reusable review baseline for the Momo Production Foundation V1 + Restaurant Audit Center V1 release.

Read `RR_RELEASE_CHECKPOINT.json` and run `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run check-rr-release-checkpoint` before starting another broad RR. The checkpoint exists to reuse evidence, not to weaken review.

## Reuse rule

- If a protected boundary fingerprint is unchanged, reuse that group’s recorded review and test evidence. Do not repeat its full review.
- If only `presentation_surfaces` changed and the exact diff does not touch auth, intake, database, scope, deployment, integrations, public claims, AI, or publishing, perform a focused delta review and affected tests only.
- If a `full-on-change` group changed, review that group and its direct consumers. Do not reopen unrelated unchanged groups.
- After a successful build, update the checkpoint’s source/deployment state and fingerprints together with `CURRENT_BUILD_STATUS.md` and `VEROXA_CURRENT_MILESTONE.md`.

## Full-review triggers

A full boundary review is required for changes to auth/session/allowlist/roles, RLS/schema/migrations/storage/secrets, signed public intake, non-Momo operations or audit conversion, hosting/domains/runtime, external integrations, live AI/publishing/payments, or material pricing/public promises.

## Current baseline truth

- Momo’s House San Antonio is the only operational restaurant.
- Other restaurants may use only the separate Audit Center and never auto-convert.
- Sites sign-in is magic-link-only and public account creation is disabled.
- Client routes remain safe-empty until verified Momo records exist.
- Runtime AI, Meta/Google connections, SEO/social execution, publishing, outbound contact, and owner walkthrough remain inactive.

The machine check verifies migration inventory, immutable applied migration checksums, scope/auth markers, and the protected file-group fingerprints. A failed fingerprint is a review-routing signal: inspect the exact diff, run only the required delta or boundary checks, then deliberately refresh the checkpoint.
