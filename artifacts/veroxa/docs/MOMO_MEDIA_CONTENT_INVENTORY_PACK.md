# Momo Media + Content Inventory Pack

Status: Current internal Team-only source-of-truth for GitHub PR #116.

## Inventory scope

The Team route `/team/momo-media-content` organizes Core Food Photos, Short Videos, Logo / Brand Assets, Storefront / Interior, Behind The Scenes, International Snacks / Drinks, Content Pillars, AI Drafting Rules, Media Usage Rights, Missing Media, Future Confirmation Questions, and Safe Internal Next Decision.

Business-truth changes require owner confirmation before any public/customer-visible use. Media usage rights require owner confirmation before public/customer-visible use. Sensitive claims are blocked until owner-confirmed. AI may use only confirmed business truth and permissioned media in later internal drafts, and those drafts remain Team-only until Team approval.
