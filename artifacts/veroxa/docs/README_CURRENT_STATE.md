# Veroxa Current-State Doc Index

Status: Short index for Faraz, Codex, and future ChatGPT/Codex sessions.

Use `ACTIVE_DOCS_INDEX.md` first as the highest-level current source-of-truth index, then these documents as the current operating model before relying on older historical notes:

- `ACTIVE_DOCS_INDEX.md`
- `VEROXA_CURRENT_MILESTONE.md`
- `CHATGPT_MANAGED_BUILD_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md`
- `CHATGPT_SITES_MIGRATION_AND_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- `VEROXA_LOCKED_OPERATING_MEMORY.md`
- `CURRENT_BUILD_STATUS.md`
- `RR_CHECKPOINT.md`
- `RR_RELEASE_CHECKPOINT.json`
- `PRICING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- `PRE_BUILD_STABILITY_CHECKLIST.md`

Older strategy maps, pre-paid activation notes, manual execution plans, Vite-auth notes, and pre-live build maps are historical planning references only. They are not current deployment, authentication, rollback, or build-order authorities.

Current strategy markers:

- Primary founder interface: **ChatGPT**. Faraz and ChatGPT decide the next outcome; ChatGPT invokes Codex, GitHub, CI, RR, and Sites tools internally.
- Active stack: **ChatGPT-managed GitHub + Codex + ChatGPT Sites**. **Vercel is retired** and is not a deployment or rollback path.
- **GitHub `main` is canonical**; GitHub merge and Sites deployment are separate actions.
- `Build it` means build/test/PR/CI/RR and green merge; `Build it, but hold for review` stops at the green PR; `Build and deploy it` also syncs the exact merged source to Sites, checkpoints, deploys, and verifies the live domains.
- Sites is public; `veroxasystems.com` and `www.veroxasystems.com` report active provider and SSL status as last verified on 2026-07-13.
- Current deployed baseline: PR #142 at `9a905c822f084fd2df5c9a2cb87c1a8286647e59`, Sites version 8, and eight production migrations. The current branch is reserved for planned PR #143, which is not opened and not merged; its ninth source migration is not applied and its Sites candidate is not published. Public marketing and audit intake are anonymous. Client and Team routes use Supabase sessions plus active profile/membership authorization; Faraz's Team password sign-in is verified and Momo Client access is not provisioned.
- **Replit is historical only**.
- Active roles: **Client and Team**.
- **Owner/Operator parked**.
- The legacy Vite `AUTH_MODE = placeholder` implementation is historical/internal and is not deployed or a rollback authority. Sites production authentication is Supabase-backed.
- Veroxa should be theoretically complete in preview/manual/pre-live mode before paid infrastructure is activated.
- The Momo production data/auth foundation and standalone Audit Center V1 are the current release. Veroxa is still AI-ready but not connected.
- Veroxa is integration-ready but not connected.
- Restaurant Onboarding has a deployed persistence and workflow foundation but still lacks complete owner-confirmed Momo evidence.
- Active public offer: **Complete Online Presence — $495/month**. `ACTIVE_DOCS_INDEX.md` is the current doc index and pricing source pointer; Starter/Growth/Premium and $295/$995 language are historical/deprecated only.
- Legacy preview-only credential strings are retired from active operating guidance and must never be reused as production authentication.

Warning: older docs may contain historical/deprecated material. Do not override `ACTIVE_DOCS_INDEX.md` or `PRICING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` with older current-looking files. Current docs override older changelog sections. Do not revive Vercel or Replit as active, Owner/Operator as active, old pricing, live AI/connectors/payments as active, or paid activation without explicit approval.
