# Live Automation V1 Controlled Momo Pilot Activation Gate

Status: GitHub PR #111 adds the Controlled Momo Pilot Activation Gate only.

## What PR #111 adds

- A Team-only internal route at `/team/momo-activation-gate`.
- A gated activation-decision helper requiring `AUTH_MODE === "real"`, `VITE_VEROXA_MOMO_ACTIVATION_GATE_ENABLED=true`, and an authenticated Team role.
- A read-only activation gate service that reuses PR #109 Momo readiness evidence and may read existing safe tables: `restaurants`, `restaurant_profile_fields`, `media_assets`, `messages`, `profile_corrections`, `activity_log`, `ai_drafts`, `reports`, and `approvals`.
- A Team navigation link labeled `Activation Gate`.
- A guardrail script for the PR #111 activation-gate-only boundary.
