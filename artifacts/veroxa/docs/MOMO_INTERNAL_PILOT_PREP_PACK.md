## Internal prep purpose

The Team-only `/team/momo-pilot-prep` surface organizes what Faraz/Team needs to verify, prepare, and collect before any future Momo owner walkthrough or real-world activation decision can even be considered.

It covers business-truth confirmation, missing or uncertain fields, media needs, access/account needs, internal walkthrough talking points, activation boundaries, and future decision blockers. It must not create fake readiness, fake metrics, fake reports, fake activity, credentials, auth users, invites, external contact, publishing, integrations, payments, webhooks, cron jobs, background jobs, scheduled jobs, or production activation state.
