# Veroxa Current Milestone

Status: highest-priority governing build direction as of 2026-07-14.

Read this file first before planning, building, reviewing, merging, deploying, or recommending Momo outreach. If an older roadmap or status note conflicts with this file, follow this file and Faraz's newest explicit instruction.

## Current verified delivery state

- GitHub `main` is canonical at `674e1a7c0d140c9b281029277baeb2e68962dac2`, but it does not currently contain the exact live product and database source.
- Live ChatGPT Sites version 13 is checkout `dd67c2dfbdc1317fd8ecf1fd3cf07aeeafa29805`; `veroxasystems.com` and `www.veroxasystems.com` remain active with healthy SSL.
- Supabase has 11 applied production migrations. The latest is `20260713222721_upgrade_restaurant_audit_engine_v3_partial_scoring.sql`, SHA-256 `304eb98db628b09fa245fba156160b043c1ba9ba2f9aeb689086a6a18ad234b2`.
- Live Sites Audit V3 and migration 11 are ahead of canonical GitHub. This is a production/source drift condition, not verified parity.
- The production-reconciliation worktree imports that observed source and adds controls. The reconciliation candidate is unmerged and undeployed. No merge commit or future Sites version is predicted.
- `VEROXA_DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.json` is the machine-readable release record. CI must verify its deterministic source and migration trees and generate an attestation from the exact `GITHUB_SHA` before merge can be considered.
- Product deployments are frozen except for the exact reviewed reconciliation release after all four required workflows are green and GitHub reports zero unresolved review threads. AI, credentials, Momo/client contact, activation, providers, publishing, billing, and new spend remain disabled.
- Vercel is retired and must not be restored.
- Supabase is the sole Auth, Postgres, and private-storage backend.
- Faraz's approved Team identity and protected Team/Momo access are operational.
- Restaurant Audit Center V3 is live for non-client restaurants.
- Momo's House San Antonio is the only operational restaurant scope.
- The Momo seven-system production foundation, manual operating rehearsal, Team work structure, approval controls, readiness evidence, monitoring, and fail-closed provider preflight exist.
- Momo remains blocked from active onboarding until the evidence-based onboarding gate passes and Faraz explicitly approves contact.

Older PR #145, Supabase-10, Sites-v11, and Audit-V2 statements in lower history describe prior checkpoints and do not override this observed production state.

## Relationship and commercial direction

Momo's House has already agreed to onboard as Veroxa's founding pilot restaurant. Momo understands that Veroxa is still being built as a product and platform, and Faraz has told them he will contact them when it is ready.

Do not treat Momo as an uncommitted prospect and do not design another sales-conversion flow for them.

Momo is free during the remaining build and founding-pilot operating period. Do not create a subscription, invoice, checkout, trial expiration, payment method, retroactive balance, or charge for Momo.

Charging Momo may begin only when:

- Veroxa has operated Momo dependably through multiple real cycles;
- the service can be repeated for additional restaurants without rebuilding the platform;
- security, support, reporting, monitoring, and recovery are dependable;
- Faraz is ready to expand and market Veroxa to additional restaurants; and
- Faraz separately approves and communicates the commercial transition.

This founding-pilot arrangement overrides generic public pricing for Momo until Faraz explicitly changes it.

## Current milestone

The active milestone is:

**Complete and prove the secure, persistent, human-controlled Momo operating loop, then begin the already-agreed onboarding.**

Stop adding disconnected planning, checklist, or dashboard pages unless they directly enable, operate, verify, or clarify a real workflow.

The immediate build priority is not another conceptual surface. It is to close the remaining operational evidence gaps across:

1. Momo Client identity provisioning and separate Team/Client account verification.
2. Restaurant membership and RLS isolation.
3. Persistent, resumable Momo onboarding.
4. Owner-confirmed restaurant truth and sensitive-claim controls.
5. Private media upload, rights, consent, Team review, and safe reuse.
6. Persistent messages, structured requests, corrections, and Team work items.
7. Truthful content drafting, approval, scheduling, and manual publication records.
8. Activity evidence, weekly updates, monthly reports, and honest attribution language.
9. Monitoring, retries, recovery, backups, and rollback.
10. Mobile and browser end-to-end QA using distinct Team and Client sessions.

## Required first-pilot operating loop

Prove this complete loop before Momo onboarding is declared ready:

`onboarding -> owner-confirmed truth -> permissioned media -> truthful draft -> Team/Faraz review -> schedule -> manual publication record -> client status -> activity evidence -> weekly/monthly report`

The first pilot should use reviewed manual execution where external connectors are unavailable.

Runtime AI, Meta, Google, and automated publishing are modular later activations. They do not all need to be live before Momo onboarding when the secure persistent manual loop works end to end and unavailable capabilities are represented honestly.

## AI, integrations, and cost direction

- Continue the free-first rule.
- Build production-quality components with existing resources.
- Do not add a paid service, usage commitment, or subscription without Faraz's explicit approval.
- Deterministic/manual content operation comes before runtime AI.
- Runtime AI requires a proven manual loop, server-side secrets, cost approval, structured outputs, safety checks, and Team/Faraz review before customer-visible use.
- Meta, Google, delivery, website, and publishing connections require Momo owner authority, supported platform capability, secure credential handling, and separate Faraz approval.
- No external action may bypass the approval and evidence system.
- Never invent restaurant facts, media rights, provider access, activity, metrics, readiness, results, reviews, ranking, revenue, ROI, customers, orders, reach, or growth.

## Exact Momo onboarding gate

Do not decide readiness from a date estimate or from a green PR alone. Tell Momo that Veroxa is ready to begin onboarding only when all conditions below pass:

- A separate approved Momo Client identity can be provisioned securely without public signup.
- Team and Client accounts are distinct and tested.
- RLS and restaurant membership isolation are proven, including negative cross-tenant tests.
- The deployed Sites source exactly matches reviewed and merged GitHub source.
- Client routes contain no unsupported completed, reviewed, sent, published, or performance claims.
- The complete onboarding flow persists to Supabase and resumes without data loss.
- Business-truth fields distinguish confirmed, pending confirmation, optional, and internal-review states.
- Private media upload, rights attestation, consent, review, and retrieval work on supported mobile and desktop browsers.
- Messages and structured requests work across separate devices.
- Team work, approvals, blockers, and activity evidence persist correctly.
- One complete internal rehearsal succeeds through onboarding, media, draft, approval, manual publication record, activity evidence, and weekly report.
- Reports are based only on real recorded activity.
- Monitoring, retry, recovery, backup, and rollback are tested for the pilot-critical path.
- Mobile/browser QA passes for the exact Momo Team and Client journeys.
- No open critical or high-severity security or data-integrity defect remains.
- The readiness system records an evidence-backed Go for onboarding; no synthetic percentage substitutes for the gate.
- Faraz explicitly approves contacting Momo and scheduling the onboarding.

## Scope boundaries

### Momo's House San Antonio

Momo remains the only operational restaurant until the founding pilot succeeds. Build and verify Momo-specific identity, truth, onboarding, media, content, approvals, work, reporting, monitoring, and recovery.

### Other restaurants

Other restaurants remain Restaurant Audit Center records or explicitly consented pending, non-operational profiles. An audit or pending profile must not automatically create a Client identity, membership, operational workspace, onboarding, publishing authority, paid service, or charge.

An audited restaurant does not become an operational client unless Faraz separately and explicitly approves conversion.

Any future conversion to an operational client requires Faraz's separate explicit approval.

## ChatGPT, Codex, GitHub, Supabase, and Sites alignment

- ChatGPT is Faraz's primary Veroxa command center.
- ChatGPT and Faraz determine the next outcome together.
- Codex is the engineering implementation workflow invoked through ChatGPT.
- GitHub `main` is canonical.
- Supabase is the sole production data/auth/storage backend.
- ChatGPT Sites is the sole deployment surface.
- Every Sites deployment must use the exact reviewed and merged GitHub source.
- A GitHub merge and Sites deployment are separate actions unless Faraz authorizes both.
- Every build must update the durable direction, current status, affected readiness evidence, and Faraz's plain-language handoff.

## Mandatory post-build continuity update

After every build, record the actual GitHub, workflow, Supabase, Sites, domain, parity, freeze, activation, and readiness state. Candidate work must remain labeled unmerged and undeployed, and the handoff must say what remains inactive.

## Mandatory two-lane reporting

Every build and review must report two separate states:

- **Veroxa delivery state:** source, PR, checks, migrations, security, deployment, domain, parity, and rollback.
- **Momo onboarding readiness:** Client identity, data isolation, truth, onboarding, media, workflow, rehearsal, QA, recovery, and Faraz approval.

A successful build or deployment does not itself authorize contacting Momo. Momo onboarding also does not require every future paid integration to be active when the secure manual operating loop is complete and truthful.

## Exact next build category

Finish the ordered reconciliation release before broader product work:

1. Keep the deployment and activation freeze in force.
2. Complete the single reconciliation candidate and exact production-source inventory.
3. Pass deterministic source/migration parity checks, AI and database contract tests, and all four required GitHub workflows; resolve every review thread.
4. Merge only the exact reviewed head, then republish and verify Sites from that exact merge without predicting its commit or Sites version beforehand.
5. Run the Momo visual/manual gate honestly without contacting Momo or manufacturing evidence; keep the decision No-Go while real evidence is absent.
6. Keep AI/provider activation deferred until the manual loop, cost controls, explicit budget approval, and separate runtime authorization exist.
7. Perform cleanup only after the reconciliation release is verified.

Post-release cleanup is a separate controlled change. Before it begins:

- record exact GitHub/Sites/database parity and a tested rollback checkpoint;
- classify each old branch through PR history and ownership rather than relying only on Git ancestry;
- preserve any unique work and obtain explicit approval before deleting branches;
- remove legacy Vite from active workspace/build/verification paths before archiving or deleting its source, with a recoverable tag or commit;
- independently verify the external Vercel Git integration is disconnected; and
- remove the inert Vercel shutdown sentinel only after that disconnection and the cleanup change are reviewed.
